There is much excitement surrounding the impending opening of the International Lunar Market, but putting money into Lunar stocks has more layers of risk than some people realize.  Whereas securities on earth have the benefit of being convertible into the currency of a country founded on habitable land, moon currency has a much shakier value.  Moon colonization has been implemented in such a way that it requires a thriving economy.  Its energy needs are of an amount that is a large magnification of those of earth.  Not only are there the difficulties of harvesting moon dust and refining it into usable energy, but the International Moon Colony's sustenance requires intense recycling, with the delicate system of air and water maintenance requiring 78% of refined moon dust energy for continued propagation.  It is this hunger for energy that will be the driving force behind the Lunar market.\
\
It is theorized by optimists that the economy will scale to the point where Shell-Beignet Dust (ILM: BDST ), the lone player in the moon dust business,  will be netting more revenue than any other company on the moon or on earth.  However, it currently is heavily margined on the moon's future success, and is operating on a loss through financing by Everline-ilk Financial (ILM: EVIL ) .  It is unknown how long this will continue, because it depends how many people are willing to immigrate to the Moon.  \
\
Much has been written about the "snowball or no-ball" concept of the moon; the idea that, as the moon grows, more people will be attracted to it, but also that few people are willing to make the intense commitment of moving from their home country to the Moon.  Moreover, it isn't like Christopher Columbus leading desperate commonfolk from their poverty-stricken existence to a land of opportunity.  The only people who are welcome on the developing moon in accordance with its strict UN-delegated screening process are the best and the brightest, the healthiest in mind, body, and spirit.  These are people with a lot to lose.  At the risk of sounding like a conspiracy theorist, this fact can be expounded upon to illustrate a subtle sign that Everline-ilk, the supposed backbone of the Lunar economy, is not as interested in Lunar expansion as it may seem.  \
\
Seven months ago, in the midst of the UN's monopoly-sanctioning negotiations with Wal-Mark and Everline-ilk, the London School of Economics submitted an unsolicited report to the UN suggesting a number of ways to hold Everline-ilk more accountable for the security of the Lunar economy.  Perhaps the most salient proposal was to require Everline-ilk to provide heavy incentives for citizens and their families to be brought to the moon for long-term settlement.  These incentive packages would include generous insurance against a Lunar economic collapse.  If the Moon thrives, Everline-ilk benefits from a growing economy, but never has to pay out the collapse insurance money; a seemingly utilitarian proposal.  \
\
Three months later, a memo between higher-ups within Everline-ilk was leaked.  It dismissed the report's economic proposals with the usual investment bank bravado.  Why would they offer insurance?  To offer colonists insurance would erode the insurance Everline-ilk has against the Moon's highly probable economic instability.  Perhaps the most chilling element of the memo was the mention of a projected "expiration date" on the International Lunar Colony.\
\
To understand the value of Everline-ilk's set-up requires an understanding of the reactive nature of a successful financial institution.  Diversification, hedging, liquid coffers--these are all allowances to creatively benefit from any errant economy.  And in addition to this resilience, Everline-ilk is poised to be able to tactically swirl the currents of the entire ocean of the economy through its investment in the only other two members of the economy, Shell-Beignet Dust and Wal-Mark (ILM: WMC ).  Everline-ilk could be thought of as having a series of filters or collective devices positioned throughout this ocean, such that the more the economy swirls with semi-predictable entropy, the more they can collect the financial sediment that floats within the current.  By this same token, Everline-ilk benefits from as many laymen being in the market as possible, with increased market volume reducing slippage for Everline-ilk's inevitable massive, market-shifting trades.\

Colleagues have called me unpatriotic.  The prince of England took this one step further, calling me "antiglobalistic" and defriending me on Facebook.  To soften this blow, I offer a piece of middle-ground advice to prospective investors.  The best way to go long on the moon is to go long on the globus.  It is more liquidable (in terms of Earth currencies) than any individual stock within the market will be when the market opens next year.\
\
For more evidence of the moon's unsure future, look no further than the fluctuations of proxy lunar markets; you can already convert Earth currencies to globus, and trade moon-dust futures.  Once again, I urge you to heed my warning--look, but don't touch!\
